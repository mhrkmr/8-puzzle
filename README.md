# 8-puzzle
The goal was to get some practice with shortest path algorithms, in this case Djikshtra's Algorithm.
The specific problem statement was to solve the 8 puzzle game but with the caveat being the start state and the destination state both will be custom and rand and inputed in form of a text files with many pairs that will need to be solved for sequentially.
