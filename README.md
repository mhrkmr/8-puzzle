# 8-puzzle
The goal was to get some practice with shortest path algorithms, in this case Djikshtra's Algorithm.
The specific problem statement was to solve the 8 puzzle game but with the caveat being the start state and the destination state both will be random and inputed in form of a text files with many pairs that will need to be solved for sequentially. Moving each tile will have a cost attached to it based on the number moved and might be different for each start-end pair. we have to minimize the cost to solve each puzzle.

The code files are provided in a separate directory, some potential sample test input files are uploaded along with outputs. Also the pdf containing the problem statement is there for potential clarifications, along with 2 python programs to ensure output is in correct format and to generate potential test files.
